    Shopping Cart Application (MEN Stack) 

    This shopping cart application is built using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) and provides a comprehensive online shopping experience.
    The project features:
    User Profiles: Users can create and manage their profiles with ease.
    Offers: The application includes a dedicated section for promotional offers, helping users find the best deals.
    Shopping Cart: Users can add items to their cart, view, and manage them before checkout.
    Order Management: Seamless order processing allows users to review their purchase history and track orders.
    
    This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of the MEN stack in creating a dynamic, data-driven web application, all without the use of React for the front end.
